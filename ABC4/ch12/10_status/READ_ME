See Section 12.7 beginning on page 579 of ABC 4/e.

In all the programs that we write, main() looks like

   int main(...)
   {
      .....
      return 0;
   }

The value 0 is received by the operating system, and that
value can be used to effect other action.  Such actions do
not concern the beginning programmer, but nonetheless, we
want to illustrate the fact that main() can return other
values, and that those values are visible to the
operating system.

Try the following commands:

   echo ""
   echo $SHELL                  ## we assume that csh is your shell
   echo ""
   cc -v -o try_me try_me.c
   source go_try

Read the the dissections beginning on pages 581 and 583
of ABC 4/e to understand the shell script go_try and
the output that gets printed on your screen when
you execute the shell script.
