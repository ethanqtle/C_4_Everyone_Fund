As explained in Section 11.14 beginning on page 524 of ABC 4/e,
we what to use the quicksort program to illustrate how the
prof utility can be used to create an execution profile.

Try the following commands:

   make                  ## compile the program with the -p option
   quicksort             ## execute the quicksort program, takes a minute or so
   echo "---"            ## write a marker on the screen
   prof quicksort        ## profile the last execution of the program

   rm -f *.o             ## remove the .o files
   rm -f quicksort       ## remove the executable file
   rm -f mon.out         ## remove the file produced by the prof command
