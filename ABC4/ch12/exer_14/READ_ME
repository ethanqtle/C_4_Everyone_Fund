The code in this directory captures some of the ideas
presented in exercise 14 on page 589 of ABC 4/e.

A tensor can be thought of as a 3-dimensional array.

The space for the elements of the tensor is
allocated all at once.  Pointer are offset
so that the indexing starts at 1, not 0.

CAUTION:
   Line 46 in the file space.c is wrong.
   You have to figure out the correct algorithm
   for pointing into the array of elements.
