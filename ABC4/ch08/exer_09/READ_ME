The two output files were created by
executing the following commands:

   cc -o pgm1 pgm1.c
   cc -o pgm2 pgm2.c
   pgm1 < /usr/dict/words > output1
   pgm2 < /usr/dict/words > output2

To save space, most of the lines in the
two files output1 and output2 were then
deleted.  To see relative running times,
give the following commands:

   grep Clock output1
   grep Clock output2
