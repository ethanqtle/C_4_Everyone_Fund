This version of the dbl_space program makes use
of the function

   access()

This function is available in C/C++ systems in
both UNIX and Windows 95/NT.  Here is the
function prototype:

   
   int access(const char *, int);

This is variation of the program on page  510 of ABC 4/e.

WARNING:
   The program is dangerous because it overwrites
   whatever filename you type on the command line.
   Suppose, for example, that you give the
   following commands:

      cc  -o replicate  pgm.c
      cp  READ_ME  my_file
      replicate  my_file
   
   The contents of my_file has been changed.
