This is the program on page 515 of ABC 4/e.
The program does not explain to the user
how it gets used.  For details, read the
dissection beginning on page 515.

Try the following commands:

   cc  -o change_case  pgm.c
   rm -f outfile
   change_case infile outfile
   cat infile
   echo "---"
   cat outfile

If you repeat the command

   change_case infile outfile

you will see that the file outfile does not
get altered.  Read the dissection to
understand why.
